# Quicksort vs Mergesort

## Quicksort

Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Average Case Time Complexity: O(nlogn)

## Mergesort

Worst Case Time Complexity: O(nlogn)

## Comparison

Mergesort has a better worst case but in the average case Quicksort is faster because of a smaller constant on the average case complexity.
