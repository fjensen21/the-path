# My Roadmap

## 1. Master the basics (1-2mo)
My first step is to go back and review all of the data structures and algorithms from college and make sure I feel VERY comfortable with them. I have listed all of those algorithms, notes, and their implementations in the DSA folder

Step 2: Review the basics of SQL and creating databases. For this I will spin up a MySQL Server (maybe something cooler) and experiement with some basic databases and SQL queries.

Step 3: Practice consuming and creating APIs. For this section I will write Typescript or Javascript and practice getting data from some fun popular APIs and doing something with it. I will then practice creating my own APIs to carry out basic functions.

## 2. Practice the problems (4-6mo)

Next I will move to practicing LeetCode like projects on Educative. My goal is to do 3 questions from each section with the following procedure:

1. Solve the naive approach like an interview
2. Learn the optimal approach and practice it

## 3. Practical Projects (2mo)

Likely at the same time as step 2, I will begin working on practical projects again. My goal will be to complete one or two practical projects for my resume.
